        <p>Okay people, let's dive in. So the first dog I had was an Akita and I fell in love with him immediately. 
            He was only a puppy when we got him (obviously) and he was cute and fluffy. Well who wouldn't, right?
            We bought him as an Akita inu but in 2001 there were some changes in this breed and they sorted him more like
            and american american akita dog. <br> Me and my husband we liked the name he got and we got used to it pretty quickly.
            So we called him Akarui Ayashi. Shortly Ayashi. It was cute, he had a red color, pointy ears and squiggly tail. 
            He was very playful and joyful and he liked long walks and running after deers. Which, obviously, we didn't want him to do
            so we used to yell at him to come back. And he was little bit stubborn so he didn't listen...
