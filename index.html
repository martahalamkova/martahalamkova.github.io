<h1>Welcome to my blog</h1>
<p> Here, you can express yourself. This blog is about your experiences with the Akitas. We want to know all everything 
    and we would be happy if you'd like to share it with us. So take your time and also take a look to our website
    and hopefully add something yours.

<h2>Akita dogs</h2>

<p> The akita is a large breed of dog originating from the mountainous regions of northern Japan. 
    There are two separate varieties of Akita: a Japanese strain, commonly called Akita Inu (inu means dog in Japanese) 
    or Japanese Akita, and an American strain, known as the Akita or American Akita. The Japanese strain comes in 
    a narrow palette of colors, with all other colors considered atypical of the breed, while the American strain comes 
    in all dog colors. The Akita has a short double-coat similar to that of many other northern spitz breeds such as the 
    Siberian Husky, but long-coated dogs can also be found in many litters due to a recessive gene.<br>
    The Akita is a powerful, independent and dominant breed, commonly aloof with strangers but affectionate with family 
    members. As a breed, Akitas are generally hardy.</p>
    

    <h2>There are two main types of an akita dog:</h2>
<ul>
    <h4><li>Akita inu or Japanese akita dog</li></h4>
    <h4><li>American akita</li></h4>
</ul>

    <h3>Akita inu</h3>
    <p>Akita inu is a kind of this dog breed origined in Japan. It is the main breed and the american came from it 
        by crossbreeding in America. There are many differences between these two breeds.</p>

    <h3>American akita</h3>
    <p>American akita is the type of crossbreed (probably with the german sheppard). It has more colors and several differences.
        For example, american akita is more vigorous than the japanese dog. It doesn't have slant eyes and it has shorter legs. Also it's 
        head is bigger.

    <h2>Japanese history</h2>
    <p> The dog breed, Akita, originated in the snowy and rural lands of Akita and Odate, mountainous regions of Japan. 
        They were trained to hunt animals such as elks, wild boar, and Ussuri brown bears. This breed in the 1600s was involved in 
        dog fighting, which at the time was popular in Japan. From the 1500s into the 1800s, the Akita served as companions for samurai.
        During the early 20th century the Akita was in decline, as a result of being cross bred with the German Shepherd Dog, St. Bernard, 
        Mastiff. As a result, a lot of specimens started to lose their spitz characteristics and instead took on drop ears, straight tails, 
        non-Japanese color (black masks, and any color other than red, white or brindle), and loose skin. A native Japanese breed known as 
        Matagi (hunting dog) was used along with the Hokkaido Inu breed to mix back into the remaining Akita Inu to bring back the spitz 
        phenotype and restore the Akita breed. The modern day Japanese Akita have relatively few genes from western dogs and are spitz in 
        phenotype after the reconstruction of the breed took place, however the larger American breed of Akita largely descends from the 
        mixed Akita before the restoration of the breed, and thus American Akita are typically mixed and not considered true Akita by the Japanese standard.
